# A small arcade machine powered by a Raspberry Pi

## Summary

I made this alongside two other friends in Robotics Club at my sixth form. This was a fun side project that I did alongside my first year of A-levels.

We wanted to make something out of the spare pieces and materials that were lying around in the Computing and DT departments. These included:

* Raspberry Pi
* GPIO expander
* Arcade buttons and joystick from eBay
* 7" LCD screen
* Plywood panels
* Breadboards and jumper wires

In the end it was massively successful. It was good enough for playing a large variety of games, and proved very popular around the school.

## Early development

Brainstorming began in January 2015
