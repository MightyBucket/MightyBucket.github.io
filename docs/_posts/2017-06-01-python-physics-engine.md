## Summary

I developed this alongside learning learning my Solid Mechanics modules at university to solidify my understanding of the subject. This project significantly developed my programming skills. The engine was derived from to develop a game also written in Python, which was then ported to C.

The objective of this project was to make a sandbox simulation environment that could be used to simulate an array of statics and dynamics problems. Users could create simple 2D shapes and attach forces to them. These forces could be described with simple expressions.
