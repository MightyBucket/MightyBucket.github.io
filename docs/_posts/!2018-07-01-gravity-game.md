# An asteroids-like game made enitrely from scratch, in both Python and C++

## Summary

Building on top of the physics sandbox engine that I developed, I developed an asteroids-like space shooter game from scratch.

The most significant changes compared to that project include collidable walls and enemies, and an intuitive level editor.

I further adapted the Python version of the game into one written in C++. This version ran much faster and was designed with portability in mind. 

A version was made for the Raspberry Pi which could run on the [arcade machine] and [modified SNES systems] that I made.
