# About me

Hello! I'm Rahul. I'm 23 years old and born and raised in London, United Kingdom. 

I've recently graduated from the University of Bath with a first-class honours masters degree in MEng Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering.

This website is being updated perpetually, so check in often!

Above all else, *I like to create things*. I've always enjoyed making novel things out of different materials, and I've always found programming exhilarating. This is exemplified by my long list of personal projects.

This goes hand in hand with *my natural curiosity for learning how things work*. I enjoy breaking down and dissecting complex systems into simple pieces. I find it beautful how we can derive complexity and sophistication from simplicity.

More recently, I have been effective in delivering change by collaborating in teams. My goal in the long term is to empower bigger change in a leadership role.
